## PrivateVC

What is DisTune PrivateVC?

It is a service allowing anyone in your server to make a private voice & text channel.

To make sure PrivateVCs will run smoothly, we've made this document. Here are the terms you are agreeing to when making a PrivateVC.
- **You agree to the server rules.** Every server puts their rules in different places, so we can't check for you. The most common place is in a channel called "rules" or "guidelines", but that changes from every server.
- **You do not use PrivateVCs for any illegal activity.** Messages may be logged for moderation. We (DisTune staff) will not check any logged message unless it's reported to us. Any illegal activities may be reported to the authorities.
